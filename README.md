# 🧠 Organization-Wide Issue & PR Templates

> _“Documentation is the blueprint of collaboration.” — Probably a Senior Dev Somewhere_

Welcome to the **Github Templates**, the central command station for all your **Issue** and **Pull Request** template needs across the galaxy (a.k.a. our GitHub organization).

## 📦 What's in the Box?

This repo contains standardized templates to ensure our workflow is:
- 🤖 Consistent
- 🛸 Efficient
- 🧪 Testable (not literally, but you get the idea)

Based on [GitHub default community health file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file) 

### 🧩 Templates Included

#### Issues

Creating a Blank Issue is allowed as well

| Template Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `epic.md` | For squashing those interdimensional code anomalies |
| `task.md` | For requesting new features and artifacts |

#### Pull Requests

| Template Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `task.md` | For making clean, reviewable, merge-ready PRs |
| `blank.md` | For opening a blank PR |

## 🧬 Philosophy

Standardized templates reduce dev friction ⚙️

Clear expectations make reviews snappier 🚀

Consistency beats chaos (unless you code in vim inside emacs inside docker) 🌀

## 🧙‍♂️ Contributing
Feel free to open an issue or PR if you’d like to suggest improvements or summon new templates. May your commits be small and your diffs be readable.
