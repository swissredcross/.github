# 🧠 Organization-Wide Issue & PR Templates

> _“Documentation is the blueprint of collaboration.” — Probably a Senior Dev Somewhere_

Welcome to the **Template Nexus**, the central command station for all your **Issue** and **Pull Request** template needs across the galaxy (a.k.a. our GitHub organization).

## 📦 What's in the Box?

This repo contains standardized templates to ensure our workflow is:
- 🤖 Consistent
- 🛸 Efficient
- 🧪 Testable (not literally, but you get the idea)

### 🧩 Templates Included

| Template Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `bug_report.md` | For squashing those interdimensional code anomalies |
| `feature_request.md` | For requesting new features and artifacts |
| `pull_request_template.md` | For making clean, reviewable, merge-ready PRs |
| `.github/config.yml` | Optional automation settings for forms |

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repo (or just fork it like a proper open source archaeologist):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/github-templates.git

2. In any target repo, configure a .github directory like so:
your-repo/
└── .github/
    └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
    └── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
Or even better, use this repo directly via GitHub’s organization-wide template support.

## 🧬 Philosophy

Standardized templates reduce dev friction ⚙️
Clear expectations make reviews snappier 🚀
Consistency beats chaos (unless you code in vim inside emacs inside docker) 🌀

## 🧙‍♂️ Contributing
Feel free to open an issue or PR if you’d like to suggest improvements or summon new templates. May your commits be small and your diffs be readable.
